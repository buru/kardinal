*kardinal makes creating, signing, and sharing petitions easier.*
[Live Site](http://kardinal.timothylevi.com)

A petition site built on Ruby on Rails as a clone of Change.org. Integrates with several APIs as well as two custom built web-scrapers in Ruby to fetch photos of legislators, and to get their descriptions from Wikipedia.org and persist them to the database.
